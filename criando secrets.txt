kubectl create secret generic kuard-tls --from-file=kuard.crt --from-file=kuard.key


Secret data can be exposed to Pods using the secrets volume type. Secrets volumes are
managed by the kubelet and are created at Pod creation time. Secrets are stored on
tmpfs volumes (aka RAM disks), and as such are not written to disk on nodes.
